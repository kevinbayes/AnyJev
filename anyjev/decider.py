        (model, question) points the batch prior at 0.75 had the best mean gain and the smallest
        loss on questions whose true label marginal is skewed (docs/when_l0_helps.md).

        shared_prefix: "auto" (default) scores the permutations of one state through the
        backend's `score_shared` when it has one, a state has at least 3 permutations, and the
        shared prefix is at least `shared_min_prefix_tokens` long (below that, one batched
        forward over the full prompts is cheaper than a prefix forward plus a suffix forward);
        True shares whenever there are at least 2 permutations, regardless of length;
        False always sends full prompts.

        adaptive_shifts (opt-in): for choice questions, read the cyclic shifts one at a time
        and stop as soon as every shift read so far, after prior correction, agrees on the
        winner and the running marginal's top-1 minus top-2 probability is at least
        `adaptive_margin` (after at least `adaptive_min_shifts` shifts). Cuts the K-fold cost
        on easy items; the marginal is then an average over a subset of shifts, so residual
        position bias is bounded by the prior correction rather than cancelled exactly.

        adapt (L2): re-estimate a head's feature standardisation from the unlabelled states a
        question is asked on, once `adapt_min_n` have been seen (label-free test-time
        adaptation). "routed" (default): only for questions served by another layout's head (a
        rewording or a re-listing), where it recovers most of the lost accuracy; True: always,
        which costs about a point on the head's own layout; False: never. docs/jev_mode.md.
